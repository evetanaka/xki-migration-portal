# 🗳️ Guide: How to Participate in XKI Governance

## This guide is for you if...

You have your **24-word recovery phrase** (seed phrase) from your Ki Chain wallet and you want to vote on governance proposals at **claim.foundation.ki**.

**No technical knowledge required.** Just follow the steps below.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Start

- **NEVER share your 24 words** with anyone. No team member will ever ask for them.
- You'll need a **computer** (PC or Mac) with **Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, or **Edge**.
- This process is **free** — no fees will be charged.

---

## Step 1: Install Keplr Wallet

Keplr is a digital wallet that works as a **browser extension** (a small program that adds to Chrome). It's the standard wallet for Cosmos blockchains, including Ki Chain.

### How to install it:

1. Open **Google Chrome** on your computer
2. Go to: **https://www.keplr.app/get**
3. Click **"Chrome"** (or Firefox/Edge depending on your browser)
4. You'll be redirected to the Chrome Web Store
5. Click **"Add to Chrome"** then **"Add extension"**
6. A small Keplr icon ("K") will appear in the top right corner of your browser

🔗 Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keplr/
🔗 Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/keplr/ocodgmmffbkkeecmadcijjhkmeohinei

## Step 2: Import Your Wallet Using Your 24 Words

Now that Keplr is installed, you need to add your existing Ki Chain wallet using your 24 words.

### How to do it:

1. Click the **Keplr icon** ("K") in the top right corner of Chrome
2. Keplr will open and show several options
3. Choose **"Import an existing wallet"**
4. Select **"Use recovery phrase or private key"**
5. You'll see **24 empty fields** — enter your 24 words **in the exact order**, one word per field
6. Click **"Next"**
7. Choose a **name** for your wallet (e.g., "My Ki Wallet") and create a **password** — this password protects Keplr access on your computer
8. Click **"Save"**

✅ Your wallet is now imported into Keplr!

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do this in a quiet place, alone, with no one looking at your screen. Your 24 words give full access to your funds.

---

## Step 3: Go to the Governance Portal

1. In your browser (the one with Keplr installed), go to: **https://claim.foundation.ki**
2. You'll see the "Legacy Transition" page with the title **"Ki Chain to Ethereum"**

---

## Step 4: Connect Your Wallet

1. In the top right corner, click the **"Connect Keplr"** button
2. A Keplr window will automatically pop up asking for permission
3. If Keplr asks you to add the "Ki Chain" network, click **"Approve"**
4. Click **"Approve"** to allow the site to see your address

✅ The button in the top right will now display your address (something like `ki1abc...xyz`) on a green background. You're connected!

---

## Step 5: Vote on a Proposal

1. Scroll down the page to the **"Governance"** section
2. You'll see a list of **active proposals** with their status (Active, Passed, etc.)
3. Click on the proposal you're interested in to open it
4. **Read the description carefully**
5. You'll see your **Voting Power** — this is the amount of XKI you hold
6. Cast your vote by clicking one of the three buttons:
   - **Yes** — You support the proposal
   - **No** — You oppose the proposal
   - **Abstain** — You don't take a side (but your participation is counted)
7. Click **"Sign & Submit Vote"**
8. Keplr will open one last time — click **"Approve"** to sign your vote

✅ Your vote is recorded! A confirmation message will appear.

> ℹ️ **Signing ≠ Paying**: Signing a message simply proves that you own the wallet. It costs nothing and does not move your tokens.

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my tokens move if I vote?
**No.** Voting does not move your tokens. You're simply signing a message that proves you own the address.

### Can I vote more than once?
**No.** Each address can only vote once per proposal.

### What is my voting power?
Your voting power equals the **amount of XKI** associated with your address at the time of the snapshot. The more XKI you hold, the more weight your vote carries.

### I don't see Ki Chain in Keplr?
Don't worry. When you click "Connect Keplr" on the website, it will automatically offer to add Ki Chain to Keplr.

### Keplr is asking me for a password — which one?
It's the password **you chose** when importing your wallet into Keplr (Step 2, point 7). It is NOT your 24 words.

### I lost my 24 words — what can I do?
Without your 24 words, it is unfortunately **not possible** to recover your wallet. There is no workaround — this is a fundamental principle of blockchain: only the holder of the 24 words has access to the wallet.

### Can I do this from my phone?
Keplr also exists as a mobile app (iOS and Android), but the experience is optimized for **desktop**. If using mobile, install the Keplr app from the App Store or Google Play.
